# Handwritten Music Recognition using Deep Learning

This repository contains code and resources for Handwritten Music Recognition using Deep Learning techniques, developed as part of an exam for the Data and Document Mining course at the University of Florence. The project reproduces the model explained in the scientific paper titled "Handwritten Historical Music Recognition by Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention Mechanism" by Arnau Baro, Carles Badal, and Alicia Fornés (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona).

## Overview

The project aims to develop a system that recognizes handwritten music notation and converts it into a machine-readable format. It involves the comparison of two models: a BLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) and a sequence-to-sequence neural network model with an attention mechanism for accurate recognition of musical symbols.

## Features

- Dataset preparation for handwritten music symbols
- Training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for symbol recognition
- Evaluation metrics and performance analysis
- Pre-trained models and weights
- Inference scripts for recognizing symbols from input images
